# GenAI Cost and Risk Monitoring Demo

A demonstration of techniques for monitoring GenAI and agentic AI workloads, including usage tracking, cost modelling, operational telemetry and risk indicators. Designed to support operational oversight in enterprise environments.

## Capabilities demonstrated

### 1. Usage and Cost Tracking
- Per-request cost estimation  
- Model-level usage breakdown  
- Budget forecasting and threshold alerts  

### 2. Telemetry and Observability
- Request traces  
- Tool-use logging for agentic workflows  
- Latency, error and retry patterns  

### 3. Risk Indicators
- Detection of unsupported responses  
- Sensitive-data leakage patterns  
- Safety filter triggers  

### 4. Agentic Workflow Oversight
- Multi-step sequence tracking  
- Tool invocation visibility  
- Behaviour pattern analysis  

### 5. Reporting
- Basic dashboards for cost and usage  
- Drift and anomaly detection signals  

## Intended audience

- GenAIOps teams  
- AI governance and risk functions  
- Enterprise architecture and engineering groups  
- FinOps teams monitoring model spend  

## Roadmap

- Add a real-time dashboard  
- Integrate evaluation metrics  
- Add cost governance checklist
